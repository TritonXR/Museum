## Introduction
GoundCrew VR is a virtual reality game application on HTC Vive that we, on behalf of the UCSD Virtual Reality Club (Now as TritonXR), designed for San Diego Air and Space Museum. Although it is still in development, players could either exploring freely in the Gallery scene to interact with real aircrafts, or jump into the Ground Crew scene to challenge levels in our gameplay demo. We are planning on deploying this application at the museum in the Historial Balboa Park after itâ€™s completed.

Here are some of our game screenshots:
